#summary how to create a new watch
#labels Documentation

In order to add a watch, you need to start Specto and open the notifier window. If there is no window called "notifications" open already, you can open it by clicking the Specto tray icon.

Once this window is open, you can click the "add" button in the toolbar, or in the "Edit" menu. A new dialog will appear, allowing you to configure the watch you want to create.

= Name =
This is only a unique name that you must give to your "watch", in order to identify it easily. Specto will often refer to this watch with that name. Try to keep it short.

= Type =
You must select a watch type. Depending on the type, the other parameters will vary, and so will the watch's behavior. Watch types include:
  * Website: Specto will watch a web page or web feed, and notify you when it has been updated
  * Email: you will be notified each time you receive new email.
  * Files or folders: you are notified when the file modified, or when the folder has new contents, modified contents or deleted contents

= Refresh Interval =
The amount of time Specto must wait before checking for updates on the watch. In addition to the refresh "number", you must specify which time unit the watch must use (seconds, minutes, hours, days).

It is strongly recommended to *set the refresh interval to a reasonably high value*. There are a few good reasons to do this:
  * Save processing power and network bandwidth
  * Prevent from being [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist blacklisted] by content providers, which could consider your requests as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Service DoS attack].
  * Keeps you concentrated on working instead of staring at Specto all the time :)

= Error Margin =
Certain watch types (such as websites) have a special mechanism we call the Mighty *Error Margin*. What it does is that it sets the minimum filesize difference (in percentage) before a watch will be considered as "updated". This feature is important for websites for example, because a lot of them use advertising content, fooling Specto into thinking they were updated. Usually, a 2% error margin seems correct, but you can fine-tune it later using the watch editing dialog.

= Finishing the process =
When you click the "add" button, the watch will be added to Specto's watch list, shown in the notifier window, and will start checking for updates. To remove it from the database, see RemovingWatches.
