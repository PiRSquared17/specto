#summary If you are looking to stop a watch from being updated, but not remove it from the watch list, this is for you.
#labels Documentation
  # Open the notifier window
  # Look at the leftmost column. Besides each watch, there is a checkbox that allows you to activate and deactivate the watch in one click.
  # Just uncheck it to deactivate/activate the watch.

The watch will still be shown in the notifier window, but will not check for updates until you reactivate it. You can also hide watches that are not activated using the View menu.
